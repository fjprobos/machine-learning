    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "Decision trees are easy tunning models that fit very well with classification. Real worl applications of a decision tree should take advantage of one of its most important feature: being very easy to understand. For example, two applications of decision trees that lead to actionable insights are Fraud Detection and Credit Scoring.\n",

    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are easy tunning models that fit very well with classification problems that include several categorical features. They are also very easy to understand, as they are based on questions that have clear answers.  The clear structure of this model also helps in the research process while developping the model. As it structures questions, it is easier to look at data that answers those questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem with decission trees is that they overfit very easy. That is why an enssemble method like Adaboost helps a lot. By merging different relatively simple decision trees, ensemble method can have a broader perspective and generalice better. However, overfitting is still a weakness related to other models.\n",

    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",

    "As this problem uses many categorical features, I think it might be a good fit to solve it. Additionally, the easy structure of the tree will help me to explain the results to Charity ML, which is something very important for the success of this project. The support of Adaboost will make this model probably very accurate and easy to understand.\n",

    "The main weekness of this model is its naive assumption. Features are treated as statistichally independent when they might not. This simplicity might also be its weakness. For most of real world applications, there is need for complex relations. It generalices relativelly well but it has high biases that could be very significant in most of the applications. Naive Bayes might allso have some mathematical limitations like divisions by zero or dealing with continous variables.\n",

    "Given a qualitative analisys of the pros and cons of different models to predict if a person makes more than $50,000 or not, we choose to preselect three of them: Adaboost with decision trees, Support Vector Macines and Gaussian Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Support Vector Machine model showed the best results both in terms of precision(>0.8) and Fscore(around 0.68), a little bit behind comes our Adaboost with decision trees with precision >0.8 and Fscore around 0.65. There is a large difference in predicting and training time though. The SVC takes a time that is two order of magnitudes higher than the Adaboost with decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we have to put on the table some evidence we know from general knowledge: First, trees perform well with categorical variables. We tested that with our results, but we can also be quiet confortable with the fact that many people have had good results with trees for such problems. The second fact is that the easy structure of the tree will help me to explain the results to Charity ML, which is something very important for the success of this project. The support of Adaboost made this model at the same time very accurate and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why I would choose to use Adaboost, which might have slightly less Fscore, but significantly less timming costs and other general perks. The Gaussian Naive Bayes was not considered in te final selection because it shows precision and fscore significantly lower than the oter two models (0.6 and 0.4 respectively), it is importance to notice though that this algorithm showed the fastest trainning and predicting times.**"

In easy terms, this method ensemble multiple simpler models into a more complex and better performing one. In this case, we choosed as the \"simple models\" decision trees. Decision trees are models that aim to classify data by answering several times a yes/no questions: It start with a single question for the whole dataset, then the dataset is divided by two depending if each observation was part of a yes or no answer to the first \"branching\" question. Then, we repeat the question/splitting process with each dataset portion until we are confortable with the solution. This is a clear and effective way of building a classifier model. Several \"decision trees\" are trainned with this scheme and then combined to make a much better one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, Adaboost uses a \"smart\" way of ensembling the set of decision trees. It uses a sequential algorithm that tries to get most of the insights of the current available information in order to decide how to add the simple model (in this case decision trees). It simply gives more importance to those simple models that show to be very accurate, or unaccurate at all (in which case we will know it is most of times wrong). It adds this simple model boundaries generating a weighted voting system.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
